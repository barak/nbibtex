For the moment, NbibTeX is not an official Debian package.
To stay up to date with NbibTeX, you can add the following to
your /etc/apt/sources.list:

   deb     http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/debian ./
   deb-src http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/debian ./

To prevent apt-get from complaining that the package comes from an
untrusted source, you can use apt-key to bless my private key:

   curl -o nrkey.txt http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/gpgkey.txt
   sudo apt-key add nrkey.txt
