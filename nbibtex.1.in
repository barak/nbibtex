.SH NAME
nbibtex \- make a bibliography for LaTeX
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nbibtex
.RI [ options ]
.IR auxname [\fB.aux\fP] 
.RI [ bibname ...]
.\"=====================================================================
.SH DESCRIPTION
\*(BX 
is a drop-in replacement for \*(OB.
It
reads the top-level auxiliary
.RI ( .aux )
file that was output during the running of
.BR latex (1)
or
.BR tex (1)
and creates a bibliography
.RI ( .bbl )
file that will be incorporated into the document on subsequent runs of
\*(LX or \*(TX.  
.PP
\*(BX looks up, in bibliographic database
.RI ( .bib )
files specified by the \\bibliography command,
the entries specified by the \\cite and \\nocite commands
in the \*(LX or \*(TX source file.
The association of \\cite command with 
.I ".bib"
entry is made by a simple query language described below.
\*(BX formats the information from the
.I ".bib"
entries
according to instructions in a bibliography style
.RI ( .nbs )
file (specified by the \\bibliographystyle command,
and it outputs the results to the
.I .bbl
file.
.PP
If the optional
.IR bibname s
are used,
\*(BX looks in the named bibliographies instead of those specified
by the \\bibliography command.
This feature can be used with the 
.B "-bib"
and
.B "-o" 
options to make a paper-specific 
.I .bib
file from larger
.I .bib
files.
.PP
The \*(LX manual
explains what a \*(LX source file must contain to work with \*(BX.
Appendix B of the manual describes the format of the
.I .bib
files. The `\*(BXing' document describes extensions and details of
this format, and it gives other useful hints for using \*(BX.
.\"=====================================================================
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-min-crossrefs=" number
The
.B -min-crossrefs
option defines the minimum number of
.B crossref
required for automatic inclusion of the crossref'd entry on the citation
list; the default is 2. 
.TP
.B "-terse"
Accepted for backward compatibility with
\*(OB; \*(BX is terse by default.
.TP
.B "-permissive"
Enables \*(BX to continue working even when some of the 
.I .bib
files mentioned in the \\bibliography command are missing.
Also tells \*(BX not to object if duplicate entries are found in
multiple
.I .bib
files.
.TP
.B "-strict"
Tells \*(BX to complain about all irregularities it spots in
any 
.I .bib
file it parses.
By default,  \*(BX (like \*(OB) complains only about entries it
actually intends to use.
.TP
.BI "-o " file
Writes the bibliography to
.I file
instead of to the default
.IB auxname .bbl .
If 
.I file
is
.BR "-" ,
writes to standard output.
.TP
.B "-bib"
Instead of writing a bibliography for use by \*(LX,
writes exactly those \*(BX entries needed by
.IR auxname.
Useful for making paper-specific 
.I .bib
files.
.TP
.B "-help"
Emit a short help message and exit.
.TP
.B "-version"
Emit version information and exit.
.PP
.\"=====================================================================
.SH EXAMPLES
To make a normal bibliography for file
.BR paper.tex:
.IP
.B "nbibtex paper"
.PP
To use the personal 
.I .bib
file
.B personal.bib
to make a paper-specific bibliography for file
.BR paper.tex ,
which should use the command
.BR "\\bibliography{paper}" :
.IP
.B "nbibtex -o paper.bib -bib paper personal"
.PP
The file
.B personal.bib
should be found on the usual
BIBINPUTS path.
.PP
To extend the bibliography
.B paper.bib
by filling in missing entries from
.BR personal.bib :
.IP
.B "nbibtex -permissive -o paper.bib -bib paper paper personal"
.\"=====================================================================
.SH QUERY LANGUAGE
To specify a paper you wish to cite, 
classic \*(OB requires an arbitrary key.
The advantage of \*(BX is that you cite a paper by the
.I contents
of the \*(BX entry.
.IP
The citation consists of a sequence of one or more 
.I constraints
separated by colons.
A constraint may be empty.
.IP
A nonempty constraint is of the form
.IB key = words\fR,
where 
.I key
is the name of a field in the \*(BX entry
and 
.I words
is a sequence of one or more words separated by dashes.
The contraint is satisfied if every word in 
.I words
is found in the field named by
.I key.
(The
.I key
may also be
.BR "[type]" ,
which matches agains the type of the entry,
or
.BR "*" ,
which looks for 
.I words
in 
.I any
field.)
.PP
For example, the following queries might match an entry for a useful
source on arithmetic:
.IP
.B "author=knuth:series=art-programming:volume=2"
.br
.B "author=knuth:title=seminumerical:year=1981
.PP
As a convenience, keys may be defaulted in up to three constraints.
In the first constraint, the default key is
.B author 
(or if there is no author,
.BR editor ).
In the second constraint, the default key is
.B year
if 
.I words 
is all digits, and is
.B title 
otherwise.
In the third constraint, the default key is
.B year
if 
.I words 
is all digits, and is
.B "[type]"
otherwise.
So for example, we could have written
.IP
.B "knuth:seminumerical:1981"
.PP
To match a word in
.IR words ,
\(*BX uses the Boyer-Moore string-matching algorithm,
so longer words are usually faster.
.PP
\*(BX's query language can be used on the command line by
.BR nbibfind (1).
.\"=====================================================================
.SH NBIBTEX STYLES AND COMPATIBILITY WITH \*(OB
Like \*(OB, \*(BX supports a variety of "styles" of bibliography.
Each style is defined by a program written in Lua,
using additional primitives suitable to construction of
bibliographies.
\*(BX provides the three standard styles in a form suitable for use
with the 
.B natbib
package.
<compatibility>
.PP
Additional styles may be created by writing new Lua code;
for example, an author wishing to create a style called
.B mcbride
would put a file called
.B mcbride.nbs
(for New \*(OB Style)
in the directory
.BR "<NBSDIR>" .
For guidance on what goes into such a file,
consult the other files in that directory and the literate source code
for \*(BX.
.\"=====================================================================
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.\"\*(BX searches the directories in the
.\"path defined by the BSTINPUTS environment variable for
.\".I .bst
.\"files. If BSTINPUTS is not set, it uses 
.\"the NBSINPUTS variable.
.\"If neither is set, it uses
.\"the system default.
For
.I .bib
files, \*(BX searches the directories in the
path defined by the BIBINPUTS environment variable if that is set,
otherwise the default.
For details of the searching, 
see
.BR tex (1)
and
.BR kpsewhich (1).
.PP
.\"If the environment variable
.\"TEXMFOUTPUT is set, \*(BX attempts to put its output
.\"files in it, if they cannot be put in the current directory.  
.\"WRONG!!!
.\"Again, see
.\".BR tex (1).
No special searching is done for the
.I .aux
file.
.\"=====================================================================
.SH FILES
.TP
.I <NBSDIR>/*.nbs
New bibliography style files.
.\"=====================================================================
.SH BUGS
Although I have made some effort in this direction, compatibility with
\*(BX does not extend to 
.B ".bib"
files containing non-ASCII characters.
