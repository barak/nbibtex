Description: Powerful, flexible replacement for bibtex
 Tools to help authors take better advantage of BibTeX data,
 especially when working in collaboration.  Instead of using BibTeX
 'keys', which are chosen arbitrarily and idiosyncratically, nbibtex
 builds a bibliography by searching the actual contents of citations.
 It can be used as a drop-in, compatible replacement for bibtex.
